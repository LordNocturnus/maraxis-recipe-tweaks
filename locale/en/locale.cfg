description=Adds a few recipes to Maraxsis that allow for more interesting crafting chains that require importing a few more products from other planets.

[recipe-name]
salt-catalysed=Superconducting Salt Electrolysis
maraxsis-fish-breeding=Tropical Fish Breeding
maraxsis-coral-growth=Coral Seeding

[technology-name]
salt-catalysed=Superconducting Salt Electrolysis
maraxsis-fish-breeding=Tropical Fish Breeding
maraxsis-coral-growth=Coral Seeding

[technology-description]
salt-catalysed=One of your space ships accidentally dropped a shipment of superconductors into the Ocean of Maraxsis. Once you found them they where covered in a fine layer of salt causing you to consider replacing the electrodes in your salt electrolysis plants with superconductors.
maraxsis-fish-breeding=A few weeks after introducing a tropical fish into your decorative fishtank you notice the population of Nauvis fish dwindling while the tropical fish thrive. After further investigation you find that tropical fish genes are dominant when breeding with Nauvis fish.
maraxsis-coral-growth=One of your cargo-pods containing calcite missed the landing pad and crashed into the ocean floor. After a few weeks you notice a significant growth of corals at the crash location.
